# TensorFlow_Decision_Forest_GradientBoostedTreesModel

Introduction
Decision Forests (DF) are a family of Machine Learning algorithms for supervised classification, regression and ranking. As the name suggests, DFs use decision trees as a building block. Today, the two most popular DF training algorithms are Random Forests and Gradient Boosted Decision Trees.

TensorFlow Decision Forests (TF-DF) is a library for the training, evaluation, interpretation and inference of Decision Forest models.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to:

Train a binary classification Random Forest on a dataset containing numerical, categorical and missing features.
Evaluate the model on a test dataset.
Prepare the model for TensorFlow Serving.
Examine the overall structure of the model and the importance of each feature.
Re-train the model with a different learning algorithm (Gradient Boosted Decision Trees).
Use a different set of input features.
Change the hyperparameters of the model.
Preprocess the features.
Train a model for regression.
